Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: This is the process of designing, building,testing and maintaining software 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: 
-1965 to 1985: The software crisis and operating system- the software crisis led to the springing of software engineering wich identified many of the problems of software development

-1985 to 1989: no silver bullet- this is the ohase hwen the cost of owning and maintaining software in te 1980s was twice as expensive as developing the software

- 1990 to 1999: prominence of the internet te rise of the internet ed to a growth in the demand for international information displays where developers changed the way of displaying information. This is also when the programmwers were pushed to use pictorial representation, maps and simple animations at a rate never seen before
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning: this is where the product or plan to be launched is defined and the requirements collected
requirements analysis- here we analyse the problem and define the solution
design- create a design framework, application architecture and prototype
coding- develop and code the required product
testing- here we test te software to ensure the functionality and quality
deployment: implementation and deployment of the software
maintenance: maintai andd support the software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

flexibility: waterfall is rigid and less adaptable to changes once delopment begins while agile allows continous adjustments based on the feedback received during each iteration
requirements gathering: in waterfall, requirements are defined upfront and considered fixed while agile allows foe evolving requirements throughout the project
customer involvement: in waterfall, customer involvement is mainly at the beginning and at the end of the project while agile actively engages customers in each iteration to provide feedback
testing: in waterfall, testing is typically done at the end of the development process
waterfall methodology is best used for projects with very concrete timelines and well-defined deliverables
agile methodology is used for complex projects where the significant constraints are not well understood 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: - software developer is responsible for designing, coding, maintaining and testing software applications 
- quality assurance engineer ensures that the software meets the quality standards and functions as intended
- project manager has the role of overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
importance of IDEs:
- Debugging tools: built in debuggers help developers to ientify and fix errors in a fast way. en example is pycharm for python
- code refactoring: IDEs offer tools for refactoring code such as renaming variables, extracting methods and optimizing code structure. an example is IntelliJ idea which offers advanced refactoring tools for java and other languages
- project management: IDEs help organize code files, dependencies and resources for easire management. an example is netbeans
- cross-platform support: many IDEs support multiple programming languages and platforms. an example is vs code
importance of VCS
- code reviews: VCS allows code reviews by allowing team members to review changes before they are merged. an example is github pull request
- accountability: every change is tracked and therefore it is easy to identify who made specific changes improving accountability and transparency. an example is git
- backup recovery: it acts as a backup for the basecode incase anyting goes wrong. an example is bitbucket
- branching and merging: developers can create branches to work on new featuress or bug fixes independently. an example is gitlab

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. remote work challenge-remote work can cause communication gaps and isolation may develop. the strategy to solve this is ensuring overcommunication to ensure clarity
2. imposter syndrome-this is where an individual feels insecure of another indidual despite the individual's competence. the strategy to overcome this isalways focusing on continous improvement rather than perfection
3. scaling systems- this is the challenge being able to build systems that can handle growth in users or data. the strategy to solve this we design for scalability from the beginning eg by using horizontal scaling
4. SECURITY CONCERNS- this is when there need to be an assurance that the software is secure from vulnerabilities and attacks. the strategy for this is to regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing
5. debugging and troubleshooting- this might be sometimes time-consuming and frustrating. the strategy for this would be to use debugging tools and logging to trace problems


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
